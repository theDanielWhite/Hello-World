# I Have the High Ground

Don't try it, Anakin. 
You underestimate my power.
Anakin made a big mistake in episode III, he joined the dark side and got his legs chopped off. Many [memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/) were created in response to the popular movies


5 Reasons that it didn't work:
* Anakin was outmatched by his master
* Anakin was too cocky and angry to focus
* Obi Wan was serious about defeating him
* Anakin was just a wee little Padawan
* He had a wife (She ended up dead because child BIRTH)


Most popular prequel quotes:
1. Do it
1. You were the chosen one
1. You were supposed to destroy the Sith, not join them
1. Hello there
1. A suprise, to be sure, but a welcome one
1. I am the Senate
